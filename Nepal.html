81.3 of the Nepalese population is Hindu, 9.0% is Buddhist, 4.4% is Muslim, 3.0% is Kirant/Yumaist, 1.4% is Christian, and 0.9% follow other religions or none religion.<br>The natural
 scenery, high mountains, incomparable cultural heritage and numerous specialties have made Nepal a well-known destination in the world of tourism with a distinct image of its own.
 However, the development of tourism is limited in numbers and within certain areas of the country only, like Bhutan. The new government has shown greater concerns about the real value
 of tourism and its role in contributing to economic growth, poverty alleviation, equity and overall tourism development in the country.</p><br>
