<p>The Minions are small, yellow shaped like pill capsules. They are depicted as being roughly one-third to one-half the height of humans but they were later revealed to be three and a half feet (1.1 m) tall. They have one or two eyes, and their irises are almost always brown (except for Bob, who has one green and one brown eye). They have no noses but seem capable of smelling, as they are shown smelling fruit and are affected by the Fart Gun. They are also shown without ears but can hear and respond to sounds. Most minions appear either bald or with a few wispy strands of black hair on their heads.The Minions are revealed to have an almost uncontrollable craving for fruit, especially bananas. They are adorable in all possible ways.<br/> May they be in  their cute looks, may they be in an attire of a villian, one eyed, two eyed absolutely all of them are cute. Their language though unable to predict sounds sweet, their unity,their attitude,their attempt to look and be dangerous inspite of all the stuffed cuteness melts the heart.

 <h2 style="color:blue"> Who voices the minions?</h2>
  <p>The lovable weirdos' unique chatter has always been part of their appeal. Minions "speak" in cute, high-pitched (possibly artificially), and emotive tones; they're voiced by Despicable Me and Minions co-directors <b>Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud</b>. Coffin and Renaud also steered the Minions' character design, and they may have been inspired by the Jawas in Star Wars or the Oompa Loompas in Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory.

We don't know for certain how the Minions' voices are produced, but it's reasonable to assume they are the result of some form of pitch modulation. Some YouTubers who've made a habit of speculating on the Minions' voices have even experimented with their own hacks to achieve a similar effect.</p><br/>

 <h2 style="color:blue"> Why do people like the minions so much?</h2>
 <p> Minions are the funniest animated creatures I admire.There are lots that make people like me feel crazy, when it comes to Minions. Though they look strange with one or two eyes in a yellow cylindrical body, they express a lot of significant life lessons. So, obviously appearances are deceptive.In many ways, they are so human in the way they act! They just don't try to hide their silly, childish, annoying, spontaneous and fun personalities by trying to act adult, like most humans do. They are also sweet to each other and always end up being friends again no matter what they might do to each other, something humans could learn from.</p><br/>
   <h2 style="color:blue"> Minions personality</h2>
 <p>They are fiercely loyal to Gru and Dr. Nefario and extremely eager to please, willingly helping with any evil plans, but at the same time they are friendly and fun-loving. Despite being relatively simple-minded, they are capable of building weapons, operating those weapons, using computers, and even driving.</p>
