 <h2>What makes Javascript unique?</h2>
<p>There are at least three great things about JavaScript:<br>

<b>1.</b>Full integration with HTML/CSS.<br>
<b>2.</b>Simple things are done simply.<br>
<b>3.</b>Support by all major browsers and enabled by default.<br>
<b>4.</b>Javascript is the only browser technology that combines these three things.<br>

That’s what makes JavaScript unique. That’s why it’s the most widespread tool for creating browser interfaces.

While planning to learn a new technology, it’s beneficial to check its perspectives.<br> So let’s move on to the modern trends affecting it, 
including new languages and browser abilities.</p>
