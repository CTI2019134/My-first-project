<h1>Natural resources!</h1>
<p><div>Natural resources are resources that exist without actions of humankind.
 This includes all valued characteristics such as magnetic, gravitational, electrical properties 
 and forces etc. On earth it includes: sunlight, atmosphere, water, land (includes all minerals) along with all vegetation,
 crops and animal life that naturally subsists upon or within the heretofore identified characteristics and substances.
 Particular areas such as the rainforest in Fatu-Hiva are often characterized by the biodiversity and geodiversity existent
 in their ecosystems. Natural resources may be  further classified in different ways. Natural resources are materials and 
 components (something that can be used)that can be found within the environment. Every man-made product is composed of 
 natural resources (at its fundamental level).A natural resource may exist as a separate entity such as fresh water, air, 
 and as well as a living organism such as a fish,or it may exist in an alternate form that must be processed to obtain the
 resource such as metal ores, rare earth metals, petroleum, and most forms of energy.</div>
